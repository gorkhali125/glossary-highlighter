        <h1>Lauren Bond and the Three Wise Aardvarks</h1>
        <div class="body">
            <pre>
                Once upon a time there was a noble girl called Lauren Bond. She was on the way to see her Christian
                MacDonald, when she decided to take a short cut through Bogstaple Woods.
    
                It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she
                felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Laura, but Laura was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic.
                She felt sure she had packed Laura. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
    
                Unexpectedly, she saw a wise aardvark dressed in a pink pinafore disappearing into the trees.
    
                "How odd!" thought Lauren.
    
                For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed aardvark. Perhaps it
                could tell him the way out of the forest.
    
                Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of
                food. There was a house made from sprouts, a house made from fruit gums, a house made from chips and a house
                made from humbugs.
    
                Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
    
                "Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
    
                Nobody replied.
    
                Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's
                chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable
                to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
    
                A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the
                houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Laura!
    
                "Laura!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
    
                The witch just shrugged.
    
                "Give Laura back!" cried Lauren.
    
                "Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
    
                "At least let Laura out of that cage!"
    
                Before she could reply, three wise aardvarks rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing.
                Lauren recognised the one in the pink pinafore that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him
                too.
    
                "Hello Big Aardvark," said the witch.
    
                "Good morning." The aardvark noticed Laura. "Who is this?"
    
                "That's Laura," explained the witch.
    
                "Ooh! Laura would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the aardvark.
    
                The witch shook her head. "Laura is staying with me."
    
                "Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Laura lives with me! And not in a cage!"
    
                Big Aardvark ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
    
                The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can
                eat a whole front door."
    
                Big Aardvark looked at the house made from humbugs and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made
                from humbugs if I wanted to."
    
                "That's nothing," said the next aardvark. "I could eat two houses."
    
                "There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Laura."
    
                Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Laura to Big Aardvark. She didn't
                think Laura would like living with a wise aardvark, away from her house and all her other toys.
    
                The other two aardvarks watched while Big Aardvark put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his
                pocket.
    
                "I'll eat this whole house," said Big Aardvark. "Just you watch!"
    
                Big Aardvark pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. He gulped it down
                smiling, and went back for more.
    
                And more.
    
                And more.
    
                Eventually, Big Aardvark started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more
                fork-fulls of fruit gums, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
    
                "Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Aardvark.
    
                Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
    
                "Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
    
                Big Aardvark never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Laura remained trapped in the
                witch's cage.
    
                Average Aardvark stepped up, and approached the house made from chips.
                "I'll eat this whole house," said Average Aardvark. "Just you watch!"
    
                Average Aardvark pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from chips. She gulped it down
                smiling, and went back for more.
    
                And more.
    
                And more.
    
                After a while, Average Aardvark started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
    
                ...and greener.
    
                A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
    
                "I'm not a bush, I'm an aardvark!" said Average Aardvark.
    
                "It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away
                before somebody gets hurt."
    
                "No! Wait!" cried Average Aardvark, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries
                and carried the aardvark away under his arm.
    
                Average Aardvark never finished eating the front door made from chips and Laura remained trapped in the
                witch's cage.
    
                Little Aardvark stepped up, and approached the house made from humbugs.
                "I'll eat this whole house," said Little Aardvark. "Just you watch!"
    
                Little Aardvark pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from humbugs. He gulped it down
                smiling, and went back for more.
    
                And more.
    
                And more.
    
                After five or six platefuls, Little Aardvark started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
    
                He stopped eating humbugs for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
    
                But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off,
                propelled Little Aardvark into the sky.
    
                "Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Aardvark. "I'm scared of heigh..."
    
                Little Aardvark was never seen again.
    
                Little Aardvark never finished eating the front door made from humbugs and Laura remained trapped in the
                witch's cage.
    
                "That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Laura."
    
                "Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from
                sprouts. And I haven't had a turn yet.
    
                "I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
    
                The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
    
                "Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the aardvarks. She won't last long."
    
                "I'll be right back," said Lauren.
    
                "What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Laura back."
    
                Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a
                small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from sprouts and toasted it
                over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole
                piece.
    
                Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
    
                "You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
    
                "I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
    
                When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from sprouts. Once more, she
                toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then
                waited for it to digest.
    
                Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from sprouts.
                Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had
                eaten the entire front door of the house made from sprouts.
    
                The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
    
                "I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe.
                "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Laura or I will chop your broomstick in half."
    
                The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened
                the door of the cage.
    
                Lauren hurried over and grabbed Laura, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Laura was
                unharmed.
    
                Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Christian. It was starting
                to get dark.
    
                When Lauren got to Christian's house, her threw his arms around her.
    
                "I was so worried!" cried Christian. "You are very late."
    
                As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Christian didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from
                her pocket.
    
                "What's that?" asked Christian.
    
                Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from fruit gums. "Pudding!" she said.
    
                Christian almost fell off his chair.
